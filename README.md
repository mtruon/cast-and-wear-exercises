# Google Cast and Wear OS Exercises
Google Cast and Wear OS development exercises for CIS 4500.

## Layout
There are two mini exercises to complete in their respective `google-cast` and `wear-os` folders.

The `app-exercise` folder contains the skeleton code for the exercise,
and the `answer-key` folder contains the completed exercise for you to reference if you get stuck.
